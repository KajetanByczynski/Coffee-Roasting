RoR during the roast should drop
Long yellowing and then more power when broning starts may scortch the coffee

Long Maillards- less acidity, more body, smaller RoR at the first crack
Short Maillards- higher acidity, higher RoR at the first crack 

At first crack RoR drops significantly for many coffees, so it's safer to hit it at higher RoR

Caramelisation runs before and after the first crack
Dark roast with high acidity - fast roast

It's not good to think about pre-first crack and post-first crack reactions as completely separate phases.
