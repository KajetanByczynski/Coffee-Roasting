1."Turning point"

These affect the turning point:
	1.Starting charge temp.
	2."Density of coffee and air" affect the initial charge temperature and turning point. Those can be measured by:
		-Density check on the coffee,
		-Barometric pressure within the environment.(that matters for big roasters 70kg+ and is corrected by airflow)
If after the turning point coffee heats up too quickly you need to lower "the gas". If it's too slow, you need more power.

2."Drying/Yellowing" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0AYlyYUG_Y)

Whole process from beginning to the end of Yellowing(usually 4-6min) is preparing coffee to move through the browning stage at the speed that we desire.
Important: Amount of the time that it takes from green to yellow does not affect the coffe flavour. 
However it has a direct impact on the next stages or the roast. 

	Too fast: 
	singeing, scorching

Machine notes:
	-metal around the drum is going to allow for some amount of ambient temperature to hit the probe.
	-generally temperature readings are going to be different for different roasters but reliable fot the single one.


As you dry coffee its moisture usually drops from 9,5%-14%(10,5%-11,5% is really nice) moisture to about 0,5%-1,5%. Further in the roast it drops closer to 0,5%.
By breaking down molecules(carbohydrates etc.) during the roast new moisture replaces the escaping one so it doesn't drop to 0%.

Mill City Roasters claim that moisture alone is not determining how you should roast. Instead density is the key.

Dense things absorb heat more quickly, less dense more slowly. For dense coffee you want it to "slow down" a bit.

For dense coffee less speed when coming out from the turning point.
Less dense coffee won't absorb heat as quickly so it needs a little energy boost = "more gas".
Guy likes to see 14 to 18 degrees of increase of temperature every 30 seconds. [Farenheit]

Moisture evaporates from the coffee as it absorbs energy.


Smelling the aroma, looking at the colour, checking temperature, looking at the timer, "trying coffee"
It's important to balance out getting info from electronic measure and sensory checking the coffee.

	Smells of coffee:
	-green: grassy, green peppers
	-early yellow: hay{PL:siano}, straw{PL:s³oma}, oats
	-further Yellow: bread, pancake, waffles, biscuits, wheat

	That's mainly because of chlorophyll. Aroma of grass gets stronger and then it turns into dry grass aroma.
