1."Turning point"

These affect the turning point:
	1.Starting charge temp.
	2."Density of coffee and air" affect the initial charge temperature and turning point. Those can be measured by:
		-Density check on the coffee,
		-Barometric pressure within the environment.(that matters for big roasters 70kg+ and is corrected by airflow)
If after the turning point coffee heats up too quickly you need to lower "the gas". If it's too slow, you need more power.
